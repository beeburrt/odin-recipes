# Odin Recipes

## The recipes assignment from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)

I'm Brian Burt, aka beeburrt. (I'm a beginner so go easy on me.)
I'm learning programming because I hope to eventually make a career of it. I know it's gonna be a long and challenging experience but I'm enjoying it so far!
As of now I've learned a good amount of Linux commands, some HTML, and a wee bit of CSS. I plan on learning a lot more Python and more about networks too.
